# The O.A.S.I.S. Project Overview

## Note on the naming of these components.

Please note that all of these components were named to thematically sound like part of the O.A.S.I.S. Project. In many cases, the name was brainstormed attempting to find a fun acronym to back it up. Please do not take these names too seriously. They are conceived in the spirit of Tony Stark and are not to be taken too literally.

## Project Components

### A.T.L.A.S. - Advanced Technical Library and Archival System (Documentation)

[ATLAS on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/atlas)

This is the project's documentation. Anything extra that isn't on this site can be found here. There may not be anything here now but detailed APIs and code documentation should live here.

### A.U.R.A - Advanced Utility for Reliable Acquisition (Embedded Helmet Firmware)

[AURA on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/aura)

This is the embedded firmware for the helmet. It communicates to the HUD for all of the environmental sensor readings.

### B.E.A.C.O.N. - Blueprint Engineering And Component Organizational Nexus (CAD Files)

[BEACON on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/beacon)

This is not only a software project but also a hardware project full of custom parts and 3D models. If you're looking for 3D printable models and details of assets owned by this project, this is the repository.

### D.A.W.N. - Digital Assistant for Wearable Neutronics (AI Assistant)

[DAWN on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/dawn)

Looking for J.A.R.V.I.S. or F.R.I.D.A.Y. integration? This is my A.I. assistant. It's specially designed with the following goals:

* Command-first processing - A special JSON file defines local commands first, then sends unknown text to an LLM for processing.
* OpenAI specially configured - OpenAI has been tweaked to provide helpful feedback with some personality.
* Speech-to-Text (ASR) chosen to be accurate and processor-efficient.
* Text-to-Speech (TTS) chosen to sound life-like and have a good UK dialect.

### Ge.N.E.S.I.S. - GEneral Nexus for Experimental Software and Informative Scripts (Odds and Ends)

[GENESIS on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/genesis)

If I needed a place to store something and it doesn't fit in elsewhere, it goes here. Things like helpful scripts, etc.

### H.O.R.I.Z.O.N. - Holographic Overlay Reconnaissance Interface: Zeroed-in Optical Navigation (Heads-Up Display)

[MIRAGE on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/mirage)

This is the display for all of the information in the suite. It interacts with all of the components and can be controlled with keyboard or voice through DAWN.

### S.P.A.R.K. - Sensor-based Positioning and Actuation Repulsor Kinetics (Embedded Hand Firmware)

[SPARK on GitHub](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project/spark)

Repulsors in the palm of your hands, motion-controlled, lights, sound, wireless.
